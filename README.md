# Text Adventure Game

The skeleton for a very simple text adventure game. It has no story, but everything works.

This is my attempt at [Exercise 45](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex45.html) in [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/index.html).

It may be run with `ruby text-adventure-game.rb`
